I use some ML algorithm to create model to predict the future 60 days carbon future price.
The original data is Substantial_environment_carbonpred_variables_20240907.csv, and I do some data preprocessing to choose high-related feature.
After that, I train the SVM and Random Forest model to preict the price. During the training, I use some skills like PCC, Sliding window, Cross validation.
